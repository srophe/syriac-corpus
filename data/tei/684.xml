                    <hi>The only other known witness to the mēmrā is Vat. Sir. 364 (ff. 88r–90v). </hi></p>
                <p>To produce this edition,
                        digital images of Vat. Sir. 120 were automatically transcribed using the
                        Handwritten Text Recognition program Transkribus in combination with the
                        model for Estrangelo developed by
                    <ref target="http://bethmardutho.org/qoruyo/">Beth
                            Mardutho</ref>. The transcription was
                        then manually corrected, and the marginal corrections - added by a later
                        hand - were incorporated. To reflect the meter of the mēmrā, the text is
                        presented in couplets of twenty-four syllables, consisting of two
                        twelve-syllable lines. Punctuation has also been added to aid the reader,
                        with (:)
                        placed after the twelfth syllable, and (܀)
                        placed after twenty-fourth syllable.
                </p>
                <p>With this edition, we
                        also offer an English translation of the mēmrā. This translation was
                        produced by three students from Beth Mardutho’s Syriac II summer course
                        (2019) using the transcription and digital images of the
                    manuscript.</p>

                    <l>Mēmrā of Mar Isaac-On the End Times</l>
                    <l>Next, concerning the end times by Mar Isaac.</l>
                    <l>Truth goaded me, just as to one sleeping, called and awakened me,</l>
                    <l>teaching me about the coming of the end times.</l>
                    <l>(Truth) became a teacher to me, and I became a student to its words.</l>
                    <l>My thoughts were filled with the teaching of the preacher of life.</l>
                    <l>I heard from him voices shouting about the resurrection,</l>
                    <l>and the mystery that speaks peace from then on unto the righteous.</l>
                    <l>Lend an ear, boy, and listen. He said to me.</l>
                    <l>Hasten to proclaim everything that I will say to you, to whoever listens to
                        you.</l>
                    <l>Open for me your mouth, child, and I will fill it (and make it) a sweet
                        spring.</l>
                    <l>Words that are sweeter than honey to those hearing them.</l>
                    <l>Instead of a whip, come, be scourged by things heard.</l>
                    <l>Instead of a rod, a report of punishments will chastise you,</l>
                    <l>if you know the meaning of scriptures. And if not, ask!</l>
                    <l>The prophets and the apostles are crying out that the end has arrived.</l>
                    <l>And nature too is teaching you with its laws </l>
                    <l>That its ornaments have come to an end, and also its beautiful things with
                        its pleasures.</l>
                    <l>Look at your years and at your days, and consider yourself:</l>
                    <l>That wickedness has come to rule; save your neck from its harms.</l>
                    <l>--------------------------------------------</l>
                    <l>An evil king has come to rule the earth, and behold, he has stirred it
                        up.</l>
                    <l>Take refuge in the king of heaven, and he will deliver you.</l>
                    <l>Satan, with his servants, thirsts for the blood of life.</l>
                    <l>It is a calamity if you fall into his hands, for he will kill you.</l>
                    <l>On farmland, he kills more than in the desert. Woe to those killed by
                        him!</l>
                    <l>In the wilderness, he causes sin more than on farmland. To where will you
                        flee?</l>
                    <l>For he chokes those on farmland with desire</l>
                    <l>And those on the mountains with hateful anxiety and with concern.</l>
                    <l>-------------------------------------------------</l>
                    <l>If you should enter farmland, the dreadful desert would be better.</l>
                    <l>If you should go out to the wilderness, your heart would break from violent
                        disturbances.</l>
                    <l>For the whole earth has been corrupted because the evil ones stirred it
                        up.</l>
                    <l>Fear is in farmland and in the wilderness -- together with terrors!</l>
                    <l>Sins are in the desert; desire in farmland; wickedness is everywhere.</l>
                    <l>Truth is oppressed and Faithfulness is constrained among its seekers.</l>
                    <l>The world has grown old, and the taste of its youthfulness has faded.</l>
                    <l>At the mouth of the grave, it stands in fear. And behold, it dies.</l>
                    <l>The earth has grown weary, and the delights of its power have diminished.</l>
                    <l>At that time it will rest, indeed it will be set free from the plow.</l>
                    <l>The way of Truth has been forgotten by many.</l>
                    <l>Everyone has tread his own path, and has gone forth erring.</l>
                    <l>Like a shameless harlot, creation has become licentious.</l>
                    <l>It committed adultery with iniquity. It married into debauchery!</l>
                    <l>The wind, which is sin, blew on a sea of iniquity.</l>
                    <l>And behold, the wicked steered their ships straight toward Gehenna.</l>
                    <l>------------------------------------------------------</l>
                    <l>They walk pridefully, though sinners, to the chasm of fire.</l>
                    <l>Their hearts did not grieve over their sins. What a great sorrow! </l>
                    <l>The star of darkness has become a sign for them to the way of death.</l>
                    <l>Those who left the way of life, they travel towards it. </l>
                    <l>Behold, the sea is swollen and the dry land is stirred up by their ways of
                        life.</l>
                    <l>Everyone hastens to act more wickedly than his neighbor. </l>
                    <l>I watched the wicked accuse the wicked on account of his deeds. </l>
                    <l>And the sinner judge his neighbor on account of his folly.</l>
                    <l>I sat, astonished. I even set my hand upon my cheek and wept,</l>
                    <l>Because his neighbor accused the wicked on account of his foul deeds.</l>
                    <l>I have watched the adulterer revile his neighbor for adultery</l>
                    <l>and the impure one who says, “Oh, impure ones,” of those who have acted
                        deceitfully!</l>
                    <l>Where is your heart, O Accuser, for you do not accuse yourself!</l>
                    <l>If justice appears to you, you also would be detested.</l>

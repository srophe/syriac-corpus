                        representing the correspondence of Papa bar Aggai, early 4th-century bishop
                        of Seleucia, with some exponents of the western political and religious
                        power. Beside the <hi rend="italic">Letter from the saint Jacob bishop (of Nisibis) to Papa</hi>,
                        the corpus includes: a letter from Eusebius of Rome to Papa, a letter from
                        Judah Kyriakos of Jerusalem to Papa, a letter from the Empress Helena to
                        Papa, a letter from Papa to the Empress Helena, a letter from Ephrem to
                        Papa, a letter from Papa to the citizens of Nisibis, the letter sent by the
                        Western Fathers on the illegal removal of Papa.</p>

                        in Christ, the distinguished priest and honorable elder, our lord Mar Papa the
                        patriarch: From Jacob, your servant and lowly disciple, [formed by] your upbringing
                        in Our Lord. Peace. My lord, when the report of the unregulated novelties committed
                        against your high priesthood by those who worship the enemy of our race was
                        transmitted to us in the writings of our reliable and trustworthy brothers and sons,
                        the believing clergymen who are with you, we were seized with consternation upon
                        reading those writings [and] a great stupor fell upon us. Sadness and sorrow<note

                        Ephrem, he who is called prophet within the Church of God, and especially upon the
                        believing women who received healing from their disease through your fatherhood, the
                        young women and their brothers who were possessed by that one who [thrust himself]
                        against you but through you was restrained; and the barren women who generated
                        thanks to your prayers and your blessings, and saw choice fruits of their wombs; the
                        other men and women who received the voice<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn14" n="14"><p
                           > A: image</p></note> of your spiritual business and
                        received help by you, and after a time, in due season, whose requests through you
                        were answered. The reading of the writings struck them so powerfully that they could
                        not remain strong enough to endure within their evil afflictions. The mourning and
                        the lamentation in your city became more grievous than the one that was upon Josiah,
                        king of Judah, and they saddened our entire assembly with the voices of their
                        mourning, saying: "Refuge of our prayer, and great harbor of our blessing, why was
                        your voice silent and [why] did your songs stop? Why did your blessed right hand dry
                        up, so that with it (i.e. the right hand) we are not signed with the sign of cross
                        anymore, and you cannot take care of us as you used to do? Who broke off our paths
                        from being with you, and our journey, so that we cannot be led to you anymore? Where
                        will we go, our blessed father, in the time of our sufferings? Whose door will us
                        knock at, as, lo, our generation is deprived of holy fathers like you?". At these
                        voices of your sons and daughters, oh father, thoughts and limbs became paralyzed,
                        and the hearts of many were held close; and like a source of water, tears descended
                        from the pupils of the men's eyes. We desire for this suffering to pass quickly away
                        from our city and for our mourning and lamentations to receive consolation from the
                        holy writings that you send to us. Those sinner priests committed sin and caused to
                        sin with them [some] simple men, those companions of ‘Aqbalaha, Miles and Habib and
                        their associates who were your disciples. You know their ignorance and are
                        acquainted with all their simplicity. In their writings, they greatly pleaded with
                        us to persuade your holiness on their behalf. If you give order and it is useful,
                        may they be absolved, for they are not evil. And as you forgave Mar Shem‘un,
                        [forgive] them as well. You consecrated them to the covenant and brought them to
                        priesthood. Through the prayer and the blessing that they received from you,
                        instruction was dispensed through them. As they came from the world and attained
                        simplicity, according to their education, they were led to that ignorance by those
                        wicked agitators of the church, upon whose heads the fraud against you, oh father,
                        and the disorder upon the entire church will swiftly turn. Upon them, fearful anger
                        will be fully executed through a just punishment. My lord, all these things that
                        those ones did, and also how you, oh father, stretched out your hand against the
                        Gospel, and about the trial that at that very moment befell you, oh father, all
                        these [things] we clearly wrote and sent to our holy Fathers through sons that you
                        requested (lit. sons of your request) and disciples of your education. They brought
                        us a request to have our writings transmitted through them. After them, we also
                        wrote and sent two other times, and they swiftly reached you, with the writings of
                        our Fathers. My lord, we and the entire church that is with us bear your pains and
                        we share your trial that [is] caused by the action of disciples of fraud, because
                        you did not bear the injustice, the calumny and the iniquity that [came] from their
                        mouth; they vomited at the presence of the Gospel; the rage overcame you, and you
                        appeared as bold. You did not withhold from yourself this discipline that, with
                        mercy, was given to you from your Lord, and if it pleases you that those companions
                        of Miles, ‘Aqbalaha and Habib with their associates, if you found mercy before your
                        eyes, my lord, count them to the same things as those who offered to you a mortal
                        poison in the eucharistic chalice and with those ones who gave false witness against
                        you in the time when you were offered to torment before pagan judges, and because of
                        their witness increased your sufferings, oppressions, lacerations and torments. In
                        the end, you forgave them and provided them with the rank of the episcopate. May
                        also they be counted like them and be forgiven. And also may we— my humble self, our
                        city, and our region—who take refuge in your prayers, be forever remembered in your
                        prayers.</p>
